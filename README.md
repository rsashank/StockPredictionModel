# Stockify! ðŸ“ˆ
### Stock Prediction Model using LSTM : https://stockify.streamlit.app/ <br>

Webapp built with Streamlit and powered by an LSTM Neural Network to analyze historical data and make predictions.<br>
Data Source: [Yahoo! Finance API ](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)<br>

Stockify makes use of LSTM to offers a range of powerful features for users to explore and analyze stock data. Users can visualize historical stock data with interactive charts, the app predicts future stock prices, conveniently displayed alongside the latest price.
